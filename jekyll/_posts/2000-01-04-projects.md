## Web Design

I love using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for webdesign,
it allows a lot of code resuability with
the way it uses html templating as well as markdown translation.
It's liquid templating engine allow if statements, loops, and other
cool features that eliminate the need to copy and paste huge 
sections of code. 

[My personal site](https://theochiu.github.io) is powered by Jekyll. It's where
I have my [blog](https://theochiu.github.io/blog), [resume](https://theochiu.
github.io/resume-site) and also a cool [photo gallery](https://theochiu.github.
io/pictures/page1.html). 

Jekyll makes blogging __super__ easy! Every blog post
is just a markdown file, and if I want to publish a post later, I can just
set a release date in the future, and when the date occurs the post will be 
viewable. 

The resume site is also great with jekyll, I created a single html template
with all the configuration details in the `_config.yml` file as variables.
This way when I need to update my resume I can just update the variables 
or add entries if the variable is a list. 

The photo gallery uses some [sneaky python](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theochiu/theochiu.github.io/master/pic_gen.py) to compile a list of pictures into
html files. These html files in a folder can be recognized as a _collection_ 
by jekyll and it makes managing many pages in sequence a breeze.

## Linux Server

I manage a [linux server](http://pineappleguru69.ddns.net/)
that sits at my desk at home in California. Since
the IP address dynamic there are some cool work arounds that I talk about 
[here](https://theochiu.github.io/2017/11/28/post2.html). I use this server
to save and backup some of my huger files. For example all the pictures 
I've ever taken on my phone are backed up on this server since it's got 
like 4TB! Also I use it as a file server since I set up FTP on it.
